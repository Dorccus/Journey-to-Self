        <h2>How the above article motivated me</h2>
        <p>My journey to self-help and personal growth is marked by a significant transition from a 
            successful career in sales consultancy to an exciting and fulfilling path in software development. 
            After completing my studies at SheCodes and WeThinkCode_, 
            I have embraced the challenges and opportunities in the tech field with enthusiasm. 
            My background in sales has provided me with essential skills like effective communication, 
            problem-solving, and a results-driven mindset, which I seamlessly integrated into my new career.

            <p>I've found joy and a profound sense of purpose with every line of code I write, 
            combining the best aspects of my previous experiences with my 
            newfound passion for software development. As a junior frontend engineer, 
            I continue to grow and learn, always eager to embrace new challenges. 
            Within this journey I also delved into areas like computer I/O functions, 
            API testing, and mastering tools like Postman on Linux.</p>
            
            <p>I've committed to continuous learning, practicing coding exercises, 
            and improving my skills in languages like JavaScript and Python. 
            Through my journey, I've found a balance between my professional aspirations and 
            personal development, always aiming to make a lasting impact in the tech community.</p>
