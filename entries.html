        <h1>Where my journey begins...</h1>
        <h3>Day 1: Starting the Journey</h3>
        <h4>Today, I decided to start documenting my journey to self-improvement...</h4>
        <p>In 2020, I was retrenched from my job due to COVID-19. Initially, 
           I had no understanding of what COVID-19 was or how it was connected to my job loss. 
           I felt angry, devastated, and, most importantly, disappointed in myself. 
           I blamed my performance, thinking it wasn't good enough, which led to my retrenchment. 
           
        <p>I convinced myself that if I had done things differently, I wouldn't be in this situation. 
           This self-blame spiraled into depression, exacerbated by the financial dependency on my siblings. 
           I felt like a failure, spending most of my time in bed, detached from the world around me. 
           Amidst a global pandemic causing widespread loss of life, my personal crisis seemed insignificant, 
           yet it consumed me. It felt as though an inexplicable force was causing pain and turmoil.</p>

        <p>During this challenging period, my family, especially my mom and siblings, were my unwavering support. 
            They have an incredible ability to transform negativity into positivity almost instantly. 
            One day, my younger sister mentioned an institution she found online that offered coding 
            and programming courses.</p>
            
        <p>I was skeptical, dismissing it as a scam due to my negative mindset. 
            Despite my disbelief, she decided to take the assessment for the course but 
            couldn't get in due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
            She assured me she would try again in 2021 to prove the institution's legitimacy, 
            but I remained doubtful, still grappling with my feelings of inadequacy.</p>
            
        <p>Between 2020 and 2021, I gradually stopped blaming myself for the retrenchment 
            and began a journey of self-introspection. I confronted my emotions daily, 
            asking myself how I truly felt emotionally and mentally. I questioned my feelings about being retrenched, 
            whether I loved or even liked my job, and if I saw myself continuing in that role for the next ten years. 
            Realizing that the answer was no, I acknowledged the need for a career change.</p>
            
        <p>This realization led me to spend considerable time online, 
            researching potential career paths. My focus shifted towards finding a career that 
            would bring me happiness beyond monetary gains, one that was stable, flexible, 
            and offered ample growth opportunities. I sought a profession where continuous learning 
            was an integral part of everyday life.</p>

        <h2>How the above article motivated me...</h2>
        <p>My journey to self-help and personal growth is marked by a significant transition from a 
            successful career in sales consultancy to an exciting and fulfilling path in software development. 
            After completing my studies at SheCodes and WeThinkCode_, 
            I have embraced the challenges and opportunities in the tech field with enthusiasm. 
            My background in sales has provided me with essential skills like effective communication, 
            problem-solving, and a results-driven mindset, which I seamlessly integrated into my new career.

            <p>I've found joy and a profound sense of purpose with every line of code I write, 
            combining the best aspects of my previous experiences with my 
            newfound passion for software development. As a junior frontend engineer, 
            I continue to grow and learn, always eager to embrace new challenges. 
            Within this journey I also delved into areas like computer I/O functions, 
            API testing, and mastering tools like Postman on Linux.</p>
            
            <p>I've committed to continuous learning, practicing coding exercises, 
            and improving my skills in languages like JavaScript and Python. 
            Through my journey, I've found a balance between my professional aspirations and 
            personal development, always aiming to make a lasting impact in the tech community.</p>
