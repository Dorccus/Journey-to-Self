# About Me

I am a passionate junior frontend engineer with a background in sales consultancy. 
My journey in software development began with studies at SheCodes and WeThinkCode_, 
earning a national certificate in IT (Systems Development). 
I thrive on blending my sales skills with coding, focusing on computer I/O functions, 
JavaScript, and Python. I enjoy platforms like LeetCode and 
Writing Creek for continuous learning and improvement.
