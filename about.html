        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate junior frontend engineer with a background in sales consultancy. 
            My journey began with a profound interest in software development, 
            which led me to complete my studies at SheCodes and WeThinkCode_, 
            where I earned my national certificate in Information Technology (Systems Development). 
            My previous seven years in sales consultancy equipped me with valuable skills such as 
            effective communication, problem-solving, and a results-driven mindset, 
            which I now seamlessly integrate into my tech career.
            
        <p>Every line of code I write is filled with excitement and purpose, 
            reflecting my commitment to learning, growing, and embracing challenges head-on. 
            I thrive on the potential of blending my sales consultancy experience with my 
            newfound expertise in software development to make a lasting impact in the tech community.</p>
            
        <p>I am particularly interested in computer I/O functions, testing APIs locally on my Linux PC, 
            and practicing JavaScript and Python to enhance my coding skills. My love for comedy, 
            although I find early comedy films puzzling, adds a light-hearted balance to my tech-focused life.</p>
            
            Outside of coding, I enjoy engaging with platforms like LeetCode and Writing Creek, 
            continually challenging myself to improve and excel. Whether it's aligning text on a 
            web page or writing a function for testing code, I approach every 
            task with enthusiasm and a desire to create meaningful solutions.</p>
